<p>This library scrapes twitter efficient by using max_id and since_id instead of using the old pages. For user timeline it scrapes 3200 tweets. 
</p>
<p>
You only need two lines of code to scrape a user timeline:
</p>
<p>
<code>
from scraperwiki import swimport
swimport('twitter_scrape').user_timeline(<username>[,<verbose>])
</code>
</p>
<p>
You can also use this library to scrape the statuses of a list, but this will only scrape around 2 months of history (?):
</p>
<p>
<code>
swimport('twitter_scrape').statuses(<username>,<list>[,<verbose>])
</code>
